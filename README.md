# CodeClauseInternship_HousePricePredictionRepo
House Price Prediction with Flask and Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as average income, number of rooms, bedrooms, house age, and population using **Linear Regression**.  
It is part of my CodeClause Internship, focusing on both core data science techniques and full-stack data delivery using Flask.
